Discord Bot to Moderate a Server - README
Introduction
This is a Python-based Discord bot that helps moderators to manage their servers. The bot includes several moderation commands that can be used to monitor and control the server. The commands include:

!kick: Kicks a member from the server
!ban: Bans a member from the server
!mute: Mutes a member in the server
!unmute: Unmutes a member in the server
Prerequisites
Before you can run the bot, you'll need to install the following packages:

discord.py
asyncio
You can install these packages using pip:
>>>>>>>>
Copy code
pip install discord.py asyncio
>>>>>>>>
Setup
Create a new Discord bot by going to the Discord Developer Portal and clicking on "New Application".
Give your bot a name and click on "Create".
Click on the "Bot" tab and then click on "Add Bot".
Under the "Token" section, click on "Copy" to copy your bot's token.
Clone or download the code from the GitHub repository.
Create a new file called .env in the project directory and add the following line:
makefile
>>>>>>
Copy code
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>
>>>>>>
Replace <your_bot_token> with your bot's token that you copied in step 4.
Run the bot.py file to start the bot.
Usage
Once the bot is running, you can use the following commands to moderate your server:

!kick: Kicks a member from the server
Syntax: !kick @<member_mention>
Example: !kick @john#1234
!ban: Bans a member from the server
Syntax: !ban @<member_mention>

This will kick the member with the username john#1234 from the server.
